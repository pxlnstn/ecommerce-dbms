# OnlineShop

A comprehensive database project for an e-commerce platform. It models a real-world online shopping system inspired by platforms like Amazon, Hepsiburada, and Trendyol. The project includes conceptual design, relational modeling, SQL implementation, triggers, constraints, and example queries, demonstrating end-to-end database development.

```sql
SELECT p.Name, SUM(c.Quantity) AS TotalSold
